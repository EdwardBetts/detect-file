## Case sensitive file systems

When using the `nocase` option, this library will attempt to detect the filepath with the following methods:

  + try to read all files in the `filepath` using `fs.readdirSync`
    - if success, compare `filepath` is a directory, so return the `filepath`
  + try to read all files in the `filepath`'s directory using `fs.readdirSync`
    - if success, do case insensitive comparasions of `filepath` to files in `filepath`'s directory
  + try to build the case-sensitive filepath starting at the root comparing filenames to directory segments.

Needing to fallback to step 3 is faster than trying to use [fs-exists-sync][] on all possible `filepath` case permutations, but there may be a performance impact if the given `filepath` isn't found with steps 1 or 2 above.

The best approach is to try to make the directory segments in the `filepath` match the actual case on the file system as closely as possible. This should reduce the need for step 3.
