# detect-file [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/detect-file.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-file) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/detect-file.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/detect-file) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/doowb/detect-file.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/detect-file)

Detect if a filepath exists and resolves the full filepath.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save detect-file
```

## Usage

```js
var detect = require('detect-file');
```

## API

### [detect](index.js#L34)

Detect the given `filepath` if it exists.

**Params**

* `filepath` **{String}**: filepath to detect.
* `options` **{Object}**: Additional options.
* `options.nocase` **{Boolean}**: Set this to `true` to force case-insensitive filename checks. This is useful on case sensitive file systems.
* `returns` **{String}**: Returns the detected filepath if it exists, otherwise returns `null`.

**Example**

```js
var res = detect('package.json');
console.log(res);
//=> "package.json"

var res = detect('fake-file.json');
console.log(res)
//=> null
```

## Case sensitive file systems

When using the `nocase` option, this library will attempt to detect the filepath with the following methods:

* try to read all files in the `filepath` using `fs.readdirSync`
  - if success, compare `filepath` is a directory, so return the `filepath`
* try to read all files in the `filepath`'s directory using `fs.readdirSync`
  - if success, do case insensitive comparasions of `filepath` to files in `filepath`'s directory
* try to build the case-sensitive filepath starting at the root comparing filenames to directory segments.

Needing to fallback to step 3 is faster than trying to use [fs-exists-sync](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fs-exists-sync) on all possible `filepath` case permutations, but there may be a performance impact if the given `filepath` isn't found with steps 1 or 2 above.

The best approach is to try to make the directory segments in the `filepath` match the actual case on the file system as closely as possible. This should reduce the need for step 3.
